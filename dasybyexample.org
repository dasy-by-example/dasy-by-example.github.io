#+title: Dasy By Example
#+EXPORT_FILE_NAME: index
#+SETUPFILE: https://fniessen.github.io/org-html-themes/org/theme-readtheorg.setup

* Hello World
#+include: "./examples/hello_world.dasy" src clojure -n
* Data Types - Values
#+include: "./examples/value_types.dasy" src clojure -n
* Data Types - References

References types are data types that are passed by their reference, pointer to where the actual data is stored.

#+include: "./examples/reference_types.dasy" src clojure -n
* Dynamic Arrays

Dynamic arrays are bounded arrays whose length can change. The length of the array cannot exceed the maximum length set where the array is declared.


#+include: "./examples/dynamic_arrays.dasy" src clojure -n
* Functions
#+include: "./examples/functions.dasy" src clojure -n
* Internal and External Functions

~:internal~ functions can only be called inside the contract.

~:external~ functions can only be called from outside the contract.

#+include: "./examples/function_visibility.dasy" src clojure -n
* View and Pure Functions

Both ~pure~ and ~view~ functions are read-only. They cannot write anything to the blockchain.

~pure~ functions do not read any state or global variables.

~view~ functions can read state variables, global variables, and call internal (view) functions.

#+include: "./examples/view_pure.dasy" src clojure -n
* Constructor

~__init__~ is a special function that is executed only once, when the contract is deployed.

#+include: "./examples/constructor.dasy" src clojure -n
* Private and Public State Variables

Private state variables cannot be accessed from outside of the contract.

Public state variables can be read by anyone, including other contracts.

#+include: "./examples/private_public_state.dasy" src clojure -n
* Constants

Constants are variables that cannot change. Any usage of a constant is replaced with its value at compile time.

#+include: "./examples/constants.dasy" src clojure -n
* Immutable

Immutables are variables that must be set at compile time and cannot change afterwards. Any usage of a constant in runtime code is replaced with its value at deployment time.

#+include: "./examples/immutable.dasy" src clojure -n
** When to use immutable variables?
- You have a variable that needs to be set when the contract is deployed, for example like setting contract owner to ~msg.sender~
- and this variable will never change after deployment
** Why declare variables as ~immutable~?
- Like constants, ~immutable~ variables save run time gas.
* If/Else
#+include: "./examples/if_else.dasy" src clojure -n
* For Loop

There are 2 ways to loop through an array, using ~range~ or directly looping through array elements.

#+include: "./examples/for_loop.dasy" src clojure -n
* Errors

Use ~assert~ and ~raise~ to check inputs and validate state.

When an error occurs, it will halt the entire function call, undoing any changes.

You will still need to pay gas for the failed transaction.

#+include: "./examples/error.dasy" src clojure -n
* Events

Events write logs to the blockchain, commonly used by application to monitor blockchain state and as a cheaper alternative to store data on the blockchain without using state variables.

Events can be efficiently searched by indexing their arguments. Up to 3 parameters can be indexed.

#+include: "./examples/event.dasy" src clojure -n
* Payable

Functions declared with ~payable~ can receive Ether.

#+include: "./examples/payable.dasy" src clojure -n
* Default Function

A contract can have a default function, executed when a function that does not exist is called. This is the same function as the fallback function in Solidity.

This function is named ~__default__~ and it is commonly used to receive Ether.

#+include: "./examples/default_function.dasy" src clojure -n
* Send Ether

There are two ways to send Ether from a contract, ~send~ and ~raw_call~. Here we introduce the simpler function to use, ~send~.

#+include: "./examples/send_ether.dasy" src clojure -n
* Raw Call
~raw_call~ is a low level function. It is used to call and send Ether to other functions.

#+include: "./examples/raw_call.dasy" src clojure -n
* Delegate Call

When contract ~A~ delegates call to contract ~B~, ~B~'s code will be executed inside contract ~A~. This will update state variables and Ether balance inside contract ~A~ and not ~B~.

Delegate call is commonly used to create an upgradable contract.

Here is the contract that we will delegate call to.

#+include: "./examples/test_delegate_call.dasy" src clojure -n

Here is the contract that will execute the delegated calls.

#+include: "./examples/delegate_call.dasy" src clojure -n
* Interface

Use ~definterface~ to define interfaces to use for calling other smart contracts.

Here is the contract that will be called via interface:

#+include: "./examples/test_interface.dasy" src clojure -n

Here is the contract executing the call via interface:

#+include: "./examples/interface.dasy" src clojure -n
* Hash Function

Dasy supports the same hash function available in Vyper and Solidity, ~keccak256~

#+include: "./examples/hashing.dasy" src clojure -n
* Re-Entrancy Lock

Dasy has a handy way to secure your contract from re-entrancy.

A re-entrancy lock can be created on a function with (nonreentrant "lock") in the decorator list.

Functions can be locked together by using the same name for the locks.

#+include: "./examples/nonreentrant.dasy" src clojure -n
* Self Destruct

~selfdestruct~ deletes the contract from the blockchain. It takes a single input, an address to send all of Ether stored in the contract.


#+include: "./examples/selfdestruct.dasy" src clojure -n
